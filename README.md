#Datpiff_noPopUp

Ever get annoyed by the fact that Datpiff launches the mixtape player in a tiny popup? I always lose track of where the popup and usually end up just pasting the link into a new tab. This userscript fixes the problem by overriding the default openMixtape() function on [Datpiff](http://datpiff.com/).

##Installation

###Chrome
1. Download the JavaScript file
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome (or Tools > Extensions)
3. Drag the js into the extensions page
4. Play a mixtape!

###Safari
* not really supported(?)

If you don't have a userscript add on for your browser, install one of the following:
* [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
* [Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
