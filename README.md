#Datpiff_noPopUp

Ever get annoyed by the fact that Datpiff launches the mixtape player in a tiny popup? I always lose track of where the popup and usually end up just pasting the link into a new tab. This script fixes that problem by opening the datpiff mixtape player in the same window rather than a little popup. 

To use, just install the script and click the "Listen" button at the top of the mixtape page!
